      <h2>Why I Started This Blog: A Journey Through Food and Simple Living</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Linus, and I'm so glad you're here. This blog is born from my love of food, the joy of intentional living, and the little things that make daily life feel meaningful. Whether I'm experimenting in the kitchen or slowing down with a cup of tea, I've always believed that the way we eat and live shapes who we become.</p>
        <h3>My Food Story</h3>
        <p>I didn't grow up a master chef—but I grew up in a home where food meant family, warmth, and care. Over time, I found myself fascinated by flavors, cultures, and the simple magic of making something from scratch. Cooking became my therapy, and this blog is my way of sharing that love with you.</p>
        <h3>Why Lifestyle Too?</h3>
        <p>To me, lifestyle isn't about perfection—it's about being present. I'll share simple wellness routines, homey touches, and ways to bring more ease into your day. Think of it as your cozy corner of the internet.</p>
        <h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>✓ Easy, soulful recipes</li>
          <li>✓ Kitchen tips and cooking confidence boosters</li>
          <li>✓ Honest thoughts on mindful living</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Let's Start This Journey</h3>
        <p>I'd love for you to stick around, try a recipe, leave a comment, or just say hi. If anything here resonates with you—welcome home.</p>
